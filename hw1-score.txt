COMMENTS ABOUT THE HOMEWORK:

- Not clear which directory represents the code. Compilation failed in directory WA-HW1, succeeded in directory
local_daos which seems incomplete though (missing the whole webapp directory with its content). web.xml file contains
references to classes (in particular, filters) that do not appear in the project. StudentServlet presents a doPost that is empty
- ER schema and its description are OK
- Good presentation logic section and very good mockups
- Good class diagram
- Sequence Diagram is OK, but you do not have classes 'USerServlet' and 'User' in your project, and UserDAO is empty.
- REST API documentation is OK



CONTRIBUTION TO THE HOMEWORK:

- Good contributions of the members, however Rehman Abdul, Bahrami Sepide, and Zabalawi Iyad in the future should also work on code, not only on the documentation/ER schema. Sohail Mohammad Muzammil should also focus more on code."
