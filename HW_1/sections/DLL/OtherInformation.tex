The n-ary relationship between Admin, Teacher and Course allows the admin to register teachers in the database and to assign one or more courses to each of the teachers. Thus, there would be no conflicts since admin does the assignment task. \newline
Also each student, after filling in the registration form must wait to be accepted by the Admin (approved=true) and then can log into the system, enrol in courses, send messages to teachers and see the course materials available.
