TORE is a Learning Management System (LMS). It's purpose to empower departments with training and development for the learners, to provide ways of professor-student communication, sharing the information and making the studying process easier. All courses  are offered through the platform. We would like to represent an application because audiences take most naturally to an LMS when it adopts modern solutions that people are used to working with. More traditional modes like paper tests and in-person instructor-led training just donâ€™t hit the mark for modern learners these days. Our team will include crucial part for any LMS as application management of profiles, signing up, logging in, enrolling/quitting a course, uploading files, the ability to register courses and to share course materials, to make announcements.
