\subsection{Builder Page}
The general builder page is organized into folders. Each folder corresponds to a specific entity in the dataset, among those that can be managed by the builders. In particular, we have a folder for the parks, one for the rides and one for the models. By clicking on each folder, the user is presented with the interface to interact with the requested resource. In particular, there is a link that allows the user to reach the page for inserting a new resource and a selector that allows the user to select a specific resource based on its unique identifier and reach the page to edit it.
