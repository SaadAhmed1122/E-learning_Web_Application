\subsection{Homepage}
The homepage contains the information on already deployed rides and parks in which such rides have been deployed. In particular, the main area of the homepage will contain a section for each park. In this section the address and the email of the park are reported, so that visitors of the website can reach the park and experience by themselves the rides. Besides address and email, each section of each park will contain a carousel with rides for that park. The carousel will be organized in cards: each card contains pieces of information on the rides. In particular, it contains the description of the model of the ride, the description of the ride itself and an image representing the ride.
