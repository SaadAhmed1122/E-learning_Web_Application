The class diagram contains (some of) the classes used to handle functionalities of the Admin, Teacher and Student in our system. 
AdminServlet, TecherServlet and StudentServlet are subclasses of the Java's HttpServlet class. They are used to 
request functionalities accessible by the repective user. The Connection Servlet is used to make connections 
to the database and consequently exchange data from it. The Authentication Servlet is used 
to authenticate each of the respective users. 


The AdminDAO, TeacherDAO and StudentDAO are subclasses of UserDAO because some of the 
functionalities are common in each of the users. Theses DAO classes are used to obtain 
access to the desired type of user in the system.
